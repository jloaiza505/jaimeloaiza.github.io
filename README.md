## Pre-Launch TODO

- [ ] Replace all placeholder project/demo images (`banner.png`, `card.png`, `demo-placeholder.gif`) with final assets.
- [ ] Finalize captions across all project media blocks.
- [ ] Complete content for prototyping evidence pages:
  - `projects/prototyping-fixture-assembly-examples.html`
  - `projects/prototyping-fabrication-integration-evidence.html`
- [ ] Review all project pages for consistent section quality (problem, architecture, implementation, results, demo, reproducibility).
- [ ] Verify all internal links and GitHub repo links.
- [ ] Validate mobile UX (navbar toggle, hero readability, banner scaling, card layout).
- [ ] Proofread site copy for grammar/typos and consistency.
- [ ] Confirm NDA/disclaimer language is final and legally safe to publish.
- [ ] Optimize image file sizes for faster loading.
- [x] Add/update favicon, canonical URLs, and baseline SEO/share metadata (description, Open Graph, Twitter) across pages.
- [ ] Optional SEO polish: add a custom social preview image and refine per-page meta descriptions.
- [ ] Run a final cross-browser check (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, mobile browsers).
- [ ] Perform final GitHub Pages deployment check after push.
